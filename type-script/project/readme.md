typeScript accept union types
 -  we union type with | 
 - literal types can be used i.e.
    type: 'as-number' | 'as-text' then we only can send either of those values
- We can use custom type 
    - type combinable = number | string
- when we store functions in variables we can use Function types
- the unknown type is not assignable with other types
